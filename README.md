## üöÄ Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use BrickLLM:

``` python
from brickllm.graphs import BrickSchemaGraph

building_description = """
I have a building located in Bolzano.
It has 3 floors and each floor has 1 office.
There are 2 rooms in each office and each room has three sensors:
- Temperature sensor;
- Humidity sensor;
- CO sensor.
"""

# Create an instance of BrickSchemaGraph with a predefined provider
brick_graph = BrickSchemaGraph(model="openai")

# Display the graph structure
brick_graph.display()

# Run the graph
result = brick_graph.run(prompt=building_description, stream=False)

# Print the result
print(result)

# save the result to a file
brick_graph.save_ttl_output("my_building.ttl")
```

<details>
<summary><b>Using Custom LLM Models</b></summary>

BrickLLM supports using custom LLM models. Here's an example using OpenAI's GPT-4o:

``` python
from brickllm.graphs import BrickSchemaGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

custom_model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4o")
brick_graph = BrickSchemaGraph(model=custom_model)

result = brick_graph.run(prompt=building_description, stream=False)
```
